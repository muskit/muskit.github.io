When playing *Take and Hold*, have you...
- gotten frustrated checking your HP against a bright ceiling?
- forgotten how many Holds you're playing for, so you don't know if you should spend all your tokens?
- tried to... wait, which hold are you on again?

This mod unobtrusively introduces UI elements and tweaks existing visuals in the *Take and Hold* gamemode to help reduce frustrations, making some play information just a little more accessible.
