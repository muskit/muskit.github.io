Created by [EliteAsian](https://github.com/eliteasian123), I contributed briefly to the game during its early stages:
- implemented a preliminary scoring system 
- created some UI elements
- proposed specifications for a JP rhythm game-inspired [timing-based scoring system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/161E3atVfryE3YvKe9rBzx-8Ee4rGVmutd43r6xdY6Dk/)
