**An open source *Rock Band*-like game created by [EliteAsian](https://github.com/eliteasian123)**. My contributions so far include:
- implementing a preliminary scoring system during very early phases
- creating some of the various animated in-game UI elements
- proposing specifications for JP rhythm game-inspired [timing-based scoring system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/161E3atVfryE3YvKe9rBzx-8Ee4rGVmutd43r6xdY6Dk/)
